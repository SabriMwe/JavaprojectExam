PROJECT NAME: PREGNANT WOMEN INFORMATION SYSTEM
1. PLANNING
Pregnant women information system is a system formed with the purpose of helping women
that are pregnant to well behave in their pregnancies journey, nowadays people don’t know
how to take care of themselves especially women with babies.
So, our system will just help those women by directing them about what food to take as a
pregnant women or what things to do and not do during that period. One of the problems
that the system will solve is the unawareness of different things about how to behave during
the pregnancy.
2. DESIGN
The system will have two external entities, user, admin/doctor. The mother should firstly
create an account with the following information (username, password, email), after the
registration she will be directed to the home page so as to access the information compose of
pregnancy from a week to 40 weeks.
The mother will have the chance of contacting directly a doctor as we will provide contacts
listed in footer and the doctor will respond directly which is not the case when it is manual,
something you go to the hospital and you just delay or you go at home without treatment.
The administration of business (admin) will have to have an account and should control every
action that is being done on the software, access on update, delete and give answers to
questions that will be asked.
3. DEVELOPMENT
Front end technology is what we see and interact with as the visitors of a website or as the
end-user of a system. It is composed of images, graphs, tables, buttons and navigation menu.
In development of front end, we used:
JAVA SCRIPT: is used to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and
browsers, it is also the most used programming language in the world, we used it for both
front end and back end.
HTML:( Hypertext Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the web, it defines the
structure and the meaning of web content. We used it to design the front end of webpages.
CSS:(Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages, we used it to alter the
front color, size and spacing our content . we also designed to put styles to web page.
We used cam. mysql. sdbc.5.1.5 as library handling my sql connection with the system. Back
end is a server that stores and arranges data and make sure that the task is well accomplished
and the software works well. In activities like writing apls , creating libraries/resand we used
jsp and servlet technologies.
DATABASE AND STORAGE
We used MYSQL database management system to store data from back-end operations. we
also used XZAMP as server and Eclipse as IDE.
4. TESTING
Testing in software means the process in which a quality assurance (QA) team evaluates how
the various components of an application interact together. In the full, integrated system or
application through the use of these Six key phases of the software testing lifecycle.
 1. Requirement Analysis
During this phase, testers map (a diagrammatic representation of an area of land or sea
showing physical features, cities, roads and environments). Once this phase is over, the actual
planning starts.
2. Test planning
Here the QA professionals think about what’s needed to complete the test and meet
objectives. We tried to consider the following:
• Whether it’s necessary to test how the application will scale.
• How many users can access the application before it scales and
• How many resources such as CPU and memory, the application has before scaled out.
3. Testing Case development
After planning our tests and what we will test, we determined the technical details for
each test case. For example; it’s necessary to deploy an application. With the use of
pregnancy manifest and some automation scripts to get the application up and
running.
4.Test environment setup
We identified where the tests will run. For example; The population is needed to
perform testing. We implemented one of the options to deploy one which is Huye
district population.
5.Test execution
As AQ engineers, we should share access to the testing environment and associated
code. The testers should store the code in GitHub and execute the automation code
via a CI/CD pipeline.
6.Test reporting
In this stage, management will review how the software performs and from there,
decide how to move forward. Without reports, tests aren’t entirely helpful. We used
test report to understand if an application works as expected.
 5.Deployment
This means the action of bringing resources into effective action in other words, it is
the mechanism through which applications, modules, updates and patches are
delivered from developers to users.
➢ We used an automated software development process.
➢ We created a checklist for deployment.
➢ We made a Backup plan.
➢ We selected the most appropriate deployment method by implementing software
that is simple to integrate with other tools and existing local applications.
